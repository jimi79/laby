we start from the beginning
we build the string that is the map, to display it in one shot
we will actually have an array of what is visible, with a color for each cell
so that will be quick to render : print color of the array
i should skip black cells though. while color = 0, increment column number.
when we have a color, print column number if != 0
is it worth it ? because i'm colored yeah i think
or maybe i should change color only of the 4 cells around me
which will actually be even tricker
we'll have an array of 'ray'


ok it's super tricky


i take the map


remove solution, or write it as a text file maybe
display hint
check min width
move view distance to some other place
add dropping items in places to remember where u've been
take parameters in cli for the size 
size will be squared, so only a '-s' is enough
automatic save and restore (which is the matrice itself actually, and x and y maybe)
traps ? then u spawn at the beginning, and the user would put warning to remember ? it seems annoying though

blinking cursor
no more light flickering


automatic save when quitting, r to reset map, save and load at quitting and reloading


do a MP version.
means : server to expose laby (which is a variable of the server ?)
json web service to query laby object 
and ncurse is a client
working with tcp or unix socket

and rest shoud be easy. we query the server to create a new laby. we have to destroy unused laby as well maybe. or a server just host one laby ? (one laby per port ?)
